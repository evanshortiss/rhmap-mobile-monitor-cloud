<p><strong>Update:</strong> 09:11 UTC Wed 5th Apr</p>
<p>We have restored service to the affected grid. Our messaging system required the removal and recreation of an exchange in order to allow services to correct connect to the relevant queue. This work has been done, and dependant services are connecting as expected.</p>
<p>As a follow up task we will investigate why the queue became blocked, and ensure measures are put in place to prevent this issue re-occurring.</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/feedhenrystatus.wordpress.com/1749/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/feedhenrystatus.wordpress.com/1749/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=redhatmobilestatus.com&#038;blog=29009608&#038;post=1749&#038;subd=feedhenrystatus&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />]]></content:encoded>
